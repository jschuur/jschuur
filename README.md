I'm a London based JavaScript developer that enjoys making curated content on niche topics more easily available. This includes news about [Mars](http://twitter.com/martiansoil) and [Moon](https://twitter.com/lunarsoil) exploration for Twitter and other side projects:

* LearnByVideo.dev: [recent programming videos on YouTube](https://learnbyvideo.dev)
* Streamers.dev: [live coding channels on Twitch](https://streamers.dev)
* localtime: [CLI to look up time and weather with auto-completion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtime-cli)
* chatgpt-repl: [Simple interactive command line interface to ChatGPT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatgpt-repl)
* [Does it Have a Feed?](https://doesithaveafeed.com): A quick way to check for a site's RSS & Atom syndication feeds

For work, I'm the Technical Integration Manager at [Playmob](https://playmob.com), where we build web games for good causes for brands.

Previously I was a hosting, developer relations and product manager over a long career as an early employee at [GameSpy/IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpy), where we created online gaming communities and infrastructure for over 1,000 games. Before that, in the stone age of the Internet, I was a web developer at an an agency that built some of the first web sites for major brands on the emerging Web.

Tools I use include React/Next.js, Tailwind, KeystoneJS, Prisma, Serverless Framework/SST, Astro, Tinybird, Retool, Metabase and more.
