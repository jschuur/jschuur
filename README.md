### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy curating content on things that interest me. Lately this has been news about [Mars](http://twitter.com/martiansoil) and [Moon](https://twitter.com/lunarsoil) exploration for Twitter and I [built a thing](https://github.com/jschuur/learnchinese.club/) to find the latest [Chinese language learning videos](https://learnchinese.club/) using the YouTube API and Gatsby.

For work, I'm the integration manager at [Playmob](https://playmob.com), where we build web games for good causes for brands.

For fun, I use JavaScript to build prototypes and then [abandon](https://londonmarkets.today/) them. I'm working on that last part[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder)

Sometimes I tweet: [@joostschuur](https://twitter.com/joostschuur).

Likes: Typos, interrupting people 20% less lately and [Lindor mint chocolate](https://www.lindt.co.uk/lindt-lindor-milk-mint-bar-38g-en-gb-04000539280009).
